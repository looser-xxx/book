Small Points

*Break down your problems.
*Minute things (which we prefer to ignore) can add to major accomplishments.
*Small habits sum up, which initially feel of no use until it reaches the threshold point.
*Your small efforts don't get wasted. It just adds up in your Karma and you get its results upon reaching the threshold point.
*Fall in love with the process instead of the goals.
*Change small habits that are part of a bigger system.


Big Points

*Small improvements compound in long run.
*Even small bad habits can lead to greater regret after reaching the threshold point.
*Stay focused on the process rather than worrying about goals.


Examples

*A bit of deflection as small as 1 degree can lead to a large incline for a large tower or building.
*After cleaning your room or organizing your files and folder( in PC), we often suffer from the same problem. Because we clean the room but we still go on with the habit of carelessness which leads to that clutter in the first place.


Quots

*You should be more concerned about your trajectory than your upcoming result.
*The score takes care of itself.


My views

*The fact that our small effects don't get wasted can be understood by the example of YouTube. You keep on working hard and on day one of your videos pop and it goes viral and your efforts show the result
*Success is like a male orgasm. The long hard work suddenly pops and gives you results.
