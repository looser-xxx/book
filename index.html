    <div class="innerMy">
        <p>-Break down your problems.</p><br>
        <p>-Minute things (which we prefer to ignore) can add to major accomplishments.</p><br>
        <p><b>-Small improvements compound in long run.</b></p><br>
        <p>-The compounding concept above is also applicable to bad habits.</p><br>
        <p>For example a bit of deflection as small as 1 degree can lead to a large incline for a large tower or building.</p><br>
        <p>"You should be more concerned about your trajectory than your upcoming result."</p><br>
        <p>-Even small bad habits can lead to greater regret after reaching the threshold point.</p><br>
        <p><b>-Small habits sum up, which initially feel of no use until it reaches the threshold point.</b></p><br>
        <p>-Your small efforts don't get wasted. It just adds up in your Karma and you get its results upon reaching the threshold point.</p><br>
        <p>The fact that our small effects don't get wasted can be understood by the example of YouTube. You keep on working hard and on day one of your videos pop and it goes viral and your efforts show the result.</p><br>
        <p>Success is like a male orgasm. The long hard work suddenly pops and gives you results.</p><br>
        <p>"The score takes care of itself."</p><br>
        <p>-Stay focused on the process rather then worrying about goals.</p><br>
        <p>For example after cleaning your room or organizing your files and folder( in PC), we often suffer from the same problem. Because we clean the room but we still go on with the habit of carelessness which leads to that clutter in the first place.</p><br>
        <p>-Fall in love with the process instead of the goals.</p><br>
        <p>-Change small habits that are part of a bigger system.</p><br>

        <p>*Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long run.</p><br>
        <p>*Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</p><br>
        <p>*Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</p><br>
        <p>*An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a large system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are building blocks of remarkable results.</p><br>
        <p>*If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p><br>
        <p>*You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p><br>

    <div class="innerMy">
        <p>-See your habits as your Identity.</p><br>
        <p>-Be proud of your Identity.</p><br>
        <p>Take challenges on your ego.</p><br>
        <p>-Be the person you want to be in the future.</p><br>
        <p>-The more we respect our behavior(good habits) the more we remain focused on it.</p><br>
        <p>-The more evidence we have regarding our identity, the more we stick to it.</p><br>
        <p>For example the more days I stay without masturbating the more proud feel about being a Bramcharia. And the more we feel to stick to this habit as it makes us feel proud.</p><br>
        <p>"The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself."</p><br>
        <p><b>-We are known for our habits.</b></p><br>
        <p>For example, we can consider every small habit done every day can be considered as a vote. Individually one doesn't have any significance but collectively it is of greater significance.</p><br>
        <p>-Chose what type of person you want to become and get more evidence(habits) in support of that.</p><br>
        <!--        <p></p><br>      -->

    <div class="innerBook">
        <p>*There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.</p><br>
        <p>*The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.</p><br>
        <p>*Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</p><br>
        <p>*Becoming the best version of yourself required you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p><br>
        <p>*The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p><br>

    <div class="innerMy">
        <p>"Behavior followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequence are by likely to be repeated."</p><br>
        <p>"Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experiences."</p><br>
        <p>-Every craving is linked to the desire to change our internal state.</p><br>
        <p>-If you don't have a craving you won't be motivated enough to form a habit and repeat the process.</p><br>
        <p>-We get a cue(or signal) of something unusual and we have a craving for it. We then start acting to fulfill our craving(reward). This process keeps on going on. And the next time we get the same cue(or signal) we know what to do.</p><br>
        <p>-To make a good habit make the cue(signal) obviously make craving more attractive the action easy and the reward satisfying.</p><br>
        <p>-To break a bad habit make the cue kind of invisible the craving unattractive. Make the action (process) difficult and reward unsatisfying.</p><br>
        <p>-Use the negative aspect of anything in your favor in a positive way.</p><br>

    <div class="innerBook">
        <p>*A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</p><br>
        <p>*The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.</p><br>
        <p>*Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p><br>
        <p>*TThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p><br>

    <div class="innerMy">
        <p>-Once a habit is created, it works automatically in the backend. Now it is upon us to use it constructively or destructively.</p><br>
        <p>-Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handÂ on our current ones.</p><br>
        <p>-Using the method of "Point-and-Call" can really help build a habit and can even be used to break bad ones.</p><br>
        <p>-List out all existing habits and habits which you want to form. Add + on good ones and on habits which you want to build. - on bad habits.</p><br>
        <p>-Calling out actions can really help.</p><br>
        <p>For example calling out everything important(keys, charger, water, etc) before leaving the house can help not to forget it.</p><br>
        <p>For example, before doing anything (in the process of forming good habits and breaking bad ones), calling out whatever you are doing can help effectively.</p><br>
        <p>For example before smoking, one can say out loud, "here I am smoking and putting my health in danger and making a step in making my family suffer". And before doing a good deed one can speak, "Here I am Improving and making my family proud".</p><br>

        <p>*With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.</p><br>
        <p>*Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.</p><br>
        <p>*The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.</p><br>
        <p>*Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.</p><br>
        <p>*The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p><br>

        <p>-Initialize every detail of your work routine, like how, when, where, etc.</p><br>
        <p>-Specifying time and location helps a lot in increasing efficiency(in long run).</p><br>
        <p>For example, we can write, "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y".</p><br>
        <p><b>-Don,t wait for some other time in the near future for performing some specific task. Rather write it down with a specified date and time.</b></p><br>
        <p>-Specifying time and place helps remove distractions and obstacles.</p><br>
        <p>-Identifying an existing habit that can help to implement a new habit is a good move. (Habit Stacking)</p><br>
        <p>For example, we can write as : After [CURRENT HABIT] is don't, I will do my [NEW HABIT].</p><br>
        <p>-A scorecard of new habits performed each day can help to encourage/motivate to continue doing it.</p><br>

        <p>*The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.</p><br>
        <p>*The two most common cues are time and location.</p><br>
        <p>*Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.</p><br>
        <p>*The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p><br>
        <p>*Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.</p><br>
        <p>*The habit stacking formula is After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].</p><br>

    <div class="innerMy">
        <p>"Motivation is Overrated; environment often matters more."</p><br>
        <p>-Try adjusting the habit in such a way that the environment makes it obvious and completing to perform it.</p><br>
        <p>The environment is the human and that shapes human behavior.</p><br>
        <p><b>-Suggestions Impulse Buying- It is a trigger when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.</b></p><br>
        <p>-Most of the actions we chose to do are not done by us but by our desires.</p><br>
        <p>For example, the above example can be easily understood by the quote in Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, which explains that our actions are controlled by our "Gunas"(Satfva, Rajas, Taom).</p><br>
        <p>-Our whole life is dependent on version so the way we see our environment can let to a greater result (Change environment wisely)</p><br>
        <p>"Every habit is initiated by cue, we are more likely to notice cues that stand out."</p><br>
        <p>-A cue can easily be ignored if they are hidden or far from sight.</p><br>
        <p>-In order to make a habit a big part of our life, make its cue a big part of our environment.</p><br>
        <p>if you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house to make it easier to grab.</p><br>
        <p>-A more persistent behavior usually has multiple cues.</p><br>
        <p>For example, observe how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a cigarette, drive in the car, see a friend smoke, feel stressed at work, and so on.</p><br>
        <p>-The same strategy mentioned in the example above can be employed for good habits.</p><br>
        <p>-Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cue for good habits is right in front of you.</p><br>
        <p><b>-Make a relationship with your environment and assigned it with different actions.</b></p><br>
        <p>For example, assign the study table for studying only, do not do anything except study there. Similarly, with our bed, Assign a different place for social media or other distractions. This would not only maintain good habits but also make the cue for bad habits more likely to be skipped as you would feel lazy to leave a specific position and change it just to waste time.</p><br>
        <p>-Use your guilt in your favor.</p><br>

        <p>*Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.</p><br>
        <p>*Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.</p><br>
        <p>*Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.</p><br>
        <p>*Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.</p><br>
        <p>*It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.</p><br>
